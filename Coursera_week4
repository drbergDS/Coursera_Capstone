Introduction. When opening a business, there are many considerations that must be made. Among these are determining the best location for the services you offer, as well as minimizing the amount of competition you may be facing. For this reason, I would like to explore the logistics of opening a breakfast diner. In the process, I may explore possible elements such as: where popular hours of surrounding business skew towards the hours before 2pm; where there are relatively few other businesses in the Breakfast Spot category; and where may be close to other businesses that may give opportunities for attracting new customers, such as churches for post-service crowds or hotels. 
Data. For this goal, I plan on looking at a medium-sized city in the Midwest, likely Indianapolis, Indiana. I may start with a larger area, then narrow it down to a smaller zone or neighborhood and fine-tune the location choices. For this, I will need to obtain the latitude and longitude of the city, as well as get more information about the neighborhoods that might be potential options. From there, I will be using Foursquare to hopefully get information about hours, other breakfast businesses in the area, and other types of venues that may attract customers.
